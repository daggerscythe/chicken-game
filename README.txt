This game is about making a rotisserie chicken.

Movement: WASD or Arrow Keys
Jump: Spacebar
Attack: E or Enter

Each boss is a step for making the chicken:
    1. Acquire the chicken by slaying it, get a Chef's Jacket
        - Chicken can attack you with its beak, has 5 health
    2. Season the chicken with Salt & Pepper, get a Chef's Hat
        - The Shakers can attack by either stomping on top of the player
            or throwing salt/pepper flakes. 
        - Player can dodge the attacks by avoiding them in time
            or by 'parrying' the flakes right before they hit
        - Each shaker has 5 health
    3. Fight the fire in the oven to cook the chicken, get the final meal!
        - The main boss is the fire in the center
        - The two corner fires are invincible, but they will hurt the player 
            if player collides with them. 
        - Corner fires shoot fireballs periodically that chase the player for 3 seconds
        - Central fire has 10 health

Player can heal by picking up hearts that spawn randomly at 2 spots at most on each level
